At the College of Liberal Arts, you’ll learn to speak Italian in the classroom—but your education doesn’t have to end there. You can [study abroad](#study-abroad-in-rome) in Rome, [apply for internships](#internships) and win [awards or scholarships](#awards-and-scholarships).

## Study Abroad in Rome
![Rome Students]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized Rome Study Abroad.jpg){:.img-right}
Students declaring a major or minor in Italian are encouraged to study abroad. Temple has its own campus in Rome, Italy, which offers courses in a variety of fields including language, art, architecture, and international business. While previous study of Italian is not a requirement for program participation, returned students recommend beginning language study before arrival.

In order to take full advantage of your time abroad, the Italian program at Temple University Main Campus offers courses in beginner, intermediate, and advanced level Italian every semester. We highly encourage our participants to register for these courses before departing for Rome because, in addition to familiarizing students with the country’s history and culture, studying the language of the host country will provide students with the necessary skills required for communication.

Your journey of global awareness begins in Philadelphia but should not end in Rome. Upon your return, it is recommended that students continue to practice their language skills by furthering their studies of Italian through the Italian program so that they may take full advantage of the Temple Rome experience.

## Internships
Each year 2-3 students are selected to serve as English Teaching Assistants via a paid internship in Lombardy, Italy through the [Study, Intercultural Training and Experience (SITE) Program](http://www.dickinson.edu/info/20126/italian_and_italian_studies/181/internshipjob_opportunities/2). Other internship opportunities include [The America-Italy Society (AIS) of Philadelphia](http://www.aisphila.org/) where a paid internship is offered for a summer archival, research, and writing project on its history and mission. The intern gains the opportunity to select historical documents, do research on the web, and prepare information to publish on the AIS website. The newly opened [History of Italian Immigration Museum](http://www.filitaliainternational.com/museum-main) in South Philadelphia also frequently seeks Italian students to intern in positions such as general museum assistance, museum office assistance and public relations.

## Study Abroad in Rome
![Rome Students]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized Rome Study Abroad.jpg){:.responsive-img .img-right}
Students declaring a major or minor in Italian are encouraged to study abroad. Temple has its own campus in Rome, Italy, which offers courses in a variety of fields including language, art, architecture and international business. While previous Italian studies are not a requirement for program participation, we recommend you begin language study before traveling to Rome.

To help you take full advantage of your time abroad, Temple University’s Main Campus Italian program offers courses in beginner, intermediate and advanced Italian every semester. We highly encourage our participants to register for these courses before departing for Rome, because, in addition to familiarizing students with the country’s history and culture, studying the language of the host country provides students with the necessary skills required for communication.

Your journey of global awareness begins in Philadelphia but should not end in Rome. Upon returning, it’s recommended that students continue practicing their language skills by furthering their studies through the Italian program so that they may take full advantage of the Temple Rome experience.

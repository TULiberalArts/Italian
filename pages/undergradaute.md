Apart from being the number one study abroad destination among university students, Italy’s importance in the corporate world and its complementary pairing with humanities studies make Italian the fourth most studied foreign language in the United States. The Italian Major at Temple University is an interdisciplinary course of study that, in addition to being built on requirements of language proficiency and core knowledge of Italian literary history, places strong emphasis on cultural, global, and national identity studies. The program’s methodology is based on a communicative approach coupled with technology–based student engagement practice to enhance the students’ language retention, level of competency, and proficiency, as well as to provide a window into Italian culture. The transferable communication and critical thinking skills acquired by the program prove invaluable to employers of liberal arts graduates.

A student majoring in Italian can expect to take courses in Italian for Business, where students not only master the sectorial language of Italian business, but also gain an understanding of the functioning of the nation’s business and economy. Special topics courses, offered periodically, explore what it meant (and means) to be Italian in relation to historical events and realties that have divided and united the Italian people. Each course utilizes cinema and media studies to further reflect on how the country’s literature and history has shaped Italian society, while in turn showcasing different modes of reading and thinking about literature.

Build proficiency with an emphasis on the Italian cultural, global and national identity. Our program provides a window into Italian culture and teaches students language retention, competency and proficiency. The major will prepare you for a career requiring analytical thinking and communication skills in fields such as education, academia, business, international business, government service, travel and tourism.

## Italian Student Remarks

I was accepted and spent three glorious months of Milan teaching at I.T.C. Gino Zappa in Saronno, Varese. This experience really strengthened my Italian language skills and gave me the unique opportunity to immerse myself in Italian culture.” _(Anastacia Garcia, Anthropology & Italian, ’11)_

> “As a student of psychology, I was always eager to explore and analyze people – the Italian program presented a wonderful opportunity to approach this ultimate objective from a unique angle. Through the acquisition and investigation of a new language and culture, my perception of and appreciation for methods of communication and cultural diversity were enhanced.” _(Emma Bushong, Psychology & Italian ’13)_

The Italian program is home to adventurous and  curious individuals who seek to learn about other  cultures, break down stereotypes and explore the world. Building on a firm foundation of proficiency  in Italian language, the Italian major is an interdisciplinary course of study that places strong emphasis on cultural, global, and national identity studies. Global awareness and cultural literacy are fundamental in order to be active citizens, capable of promoting change and innovation. Our students are taught the vital critical thinking, public speaking and problem solving skills necessary to thrive both at home and abroad.

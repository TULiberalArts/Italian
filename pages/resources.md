## Study Abroad in Rome

Students declaring a major or minor in Italian are encouraged to study abroad. Temple has its own campus in Rome, Italy, which offers courses in a variety of fields including language, art, architecture, and international business. While previous study of Italian is not a requirement for program participation, returned students recommend beginning language study before arrival.

In order to take full advantage of your time abroad, the Italian program at Temple University Main Campus offers courses in beginner, intermediate, and advanced level Italian every semester. We highly encourage our participants to register for these courses before departing for Rome because, in addition to familiarizing students with the country’s history and culture, studying the language of the host country will provide students with the necessary skills required for communication.

Your journey of global awareness begins in Philadelphia but should not end in Rome. Upon your return, it is recommended that students continue to practice their language skills by furthering their studies of Italian through the Italian program so that they may take full advantage of the Temple Rome experience.

Application Deadline: February 15, 2016

## Italian Student Remarks

“The most momentous moment for me is the suggestion and gentle persuasion of Professor Gragnani to apply for the SITE program in Lombardia. I was accepted and spent three glorious months of Milan teaching at I.T.C. Gino Zappa in Saronno, Varese. This experience really strengthened my Italian language skills and gave me the unique opportunity to immerse myself in Italian culture.” (Anastacia Garcia, Anthropology & Italian, ’11)

“As a student of psychology, I was always eager to explore and analyze people – the Italian program presented a wonderful opportunity to approach this ultimate objective from a unique angle. Through the acquisition and investigation of a new language and culture, my perception of and appreciation for methods of communication and cultural diversity were enhanced.” (Emma Bushong, Psychology & Italian ’13)

## Careers

Students who have earned a Bachelor’s degree in Italian have been accepted into fully funded Ivy-league graduate doctoral programs while others have had success in the corporate world, both within the United States and abroad.

## Internships

Each year 2-3 students are selected to serve as English Teaching Assistants via a paid internship in Lombardy, Italy through the Study, Intercultural Training and Experience (SITE) Program. Other internship opportunities include The America-Italy Society (AIS) of Philadelphia where a paid internship is offered for a summer archival, research, and writing project on its history and mission. The intern gains the opportunity to select historical documents, do research on the web, and prepare information to publish on the AIS website. The newly opened History of Italian Immigration Museum in South Philadelphia also frequently seeks Italian students to intern in positions such as general museum assistance, museum office assistance, and public relations.

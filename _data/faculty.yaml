    Carmelo Galati, Assistant Professor of Italian, earned his BA in English Literature and Italian in 2003 from the University of Pittsburgh. He received his Ph.D. from Rutgers University in 2011. His research takes an interdisciplinary approach towards Dante and Medieval Studies by focusing on their adaptation and appropriation in modern and postmodern literary and popular culture. His scholarship aims to bridge together the medieval and the modern, making the texts accessible as well as clarifying their relevance today. In his studies, he is interested in how contemporary productions transform, modify, and extend Dante’s Commedia, thereby using the medieval poem as a springboard for the creation of newer, original works, while showcasing different modes of reading and thinking about literature. For Carmelo teaching is an integrative process that surpasses lecturing in front of a class. Teaching is the opportunity to reach out to students, to have them discover more about the world, literature and perhaps about themselves. His enthusiasm and passion for teaching has inspired many of his students to pursue their study of Italian as majors or minors, study abroad, and pursue graduate studies. He has been teaching Italian language and literature courses at Temple University since 2007.
